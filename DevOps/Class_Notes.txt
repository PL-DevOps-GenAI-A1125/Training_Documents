	Introduction to DevOps :::
	
	What is DevOps ?
	
	
	IT Service: 
	
	Software Applications :::
	
		- Web Applications
		
		- Desktops Applications
		
		- Mobile Applications
	
		- Embedded Applications 
	
	
	
	Software Development Life Cycle :
	
		- Requirement Analysis 
		
		- Design & Documentation 
		
		- Code & Development 
		
		- Testing 
		
		- Implemented to Production 
		
		- Monitor & Maintain
	
				
	Waterfall Model: 
	
		- Linear in fashion
		- It strictly follows top-down approach
		- It is meant only for Monolith Application Architecture
		

				- Desktops Applications ::
					
					- Super Market Billing Management :
					
						-> Functions 
						
							-> Inventory Management 
							-> User Interface Design 
							-> User Profile Management
							-> Billing Management 
							-> Payment Management	
								- CASH Payment 
								- Card Payment 
									- Online Payment 
									- UPI Payment
		
		
	Main_Project:
	
		- Requirement Analysis 		--> 12 Months 
		
		- Design & Documentation 
		
		- Code & Development 			5 Month
		
		- Testing 
		
		- Implemented to Production 
		
		- Monitor & Maintain			
		
		
	Enhancement_Project:
	
		- Requirement Analysis 		--> 4 Months 
		
		- Design & Documentation 
		
		- Code & Development 			
		
		- Testing 
		
		- Implemented to Production 
		
		- Monitor & Maintain
	
	
	
	
	AGILE Methodology ::::

				- Desktops Applications ::
					
					- Super Market Billing Management :
					
						-> Functions/Iterations/Modules
						
							-> Inventory Management 
							-> User Interface Design 
							-> User Profile Management
							-> Billing Management 
							-> Payment Management	
								- CASH Payment 
								- Card Payment 	
	
	Iteration 1: Inventory Management

		- Requirement Analysis 
		
		- Design & Documentation 
		
		- Code & Development 
		
		- Testing 
		
		- Implemented to Production with proper approval
		
		- Monitor & Maintain	
	
	
	Iteration 2: User Interface Design 

		- Requirement Analysis 
		
		- Design & Documentation 
		
		- Code & Development 
		
		- Testing 
		
		- Implemented to Production with proper approval
		
		- Monitor & Maintain	
	

	Iteration 3: User Profile Management 

		- Requirement Analysis 
		
		- Design & Documentation 
		
		- Code & Development 
		
		- Testing 
		
		- Implemented to Production with proper approval
		
		- Monitor & Maintain
		

	Iteration nth : Online Payment

		- Requirement Analysis 
		
		- Design & Documentation 
		
		- Code & Development 
		
		- Testing 
		
		- Implemented to Production with proper approval
		
		- Monitor & Maintain
		
	
	Using AGILE Methodologies:
	
		- We can achieve:
		
			- Continuous Development
			
			- Continuous Integration 
			
			- Continuous Testing 
			
			- Continuous Delivery 
			
				- It expect Manual Approval to release the changes to Production Environment.
			
			
		- We cannot achieve: 
		
			- Continuous Deployment 
				
				- It Never expect any Manual Approval to release the changes to Production Environment.
			
			
				
	- DevOps ::::
	
		DevOps is Software Development Strategy, which promote Collaboration between the Teams like Development Team and Operations Team to achieve Continuous Development, Continuous Integration, Continuous Testing, Continuous Delivery, Continuous Deployment and Continuous Monitoring in more automated fashion.
		
	
	How to Implement DevOps ?
	
		- Identify the Teams involved in overall SDLC Process :
		
			- DevOps Team 
				- Infra-Structure Management Team 
				- Application Development Team 
				- Testing Team 						50 Test Servers - 			
				- Release Management Team 
				- Production Support Team 
				- Production Monitoring Team 
				- IT Security Team 
				
		
		- Environments :
		
			Non-Prod Environments 											Production Environments			
			
				- Dev Environment
				
				- Test Environments 
				
					- QA Environment 
						Quality Assurance
					
					- UAT Environment		======================>				Production Servers (LIVE Environment)
						User Acceptance Testing 
					
					Eg.: 
					Telecomm Services :
					
						- New Offer 
						
						- Walk-in to nearest outlet 
						
						
		- Application Architecture :
		
			- Monolith Application Architecture
				- These are Tightly-Coupled Application Architecture
				- All the dependencies and functions are tighly coupled.
				- We cannot achieve Continuous Deployment. Only Continuous Delivery is possible.
			
			
			- Micro-Service Based Application Architecture
				- These are loosely Coupled Application Architecture
				- Each and every function is considered as a Micro-Service
				- Each Micro-Service will be independently Developed and Deployed to Production
				- Using Micro-Service Application Architecture only we can achieve Continuous Deployment.
